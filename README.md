##CLook

CLook is an application which answers one of the most asked question of ‘where to do a MOOC from?’. Every tech student has wondered where to start learning Python and wondered whether Coursera or Udacity is the best choice for him/her. Each CS student has spent hours poring over numerous open courseware sites, instead of actually spending that time on learning something. CLook solves this problem and spares students the time and effort of scouring websites for the course of their choice, so that he/she can utilise their time most efficiently and productively in learning something new. CLook is a Web and Android-based application which lists out MOOCs based on your subject and university preference. The application sorts all courses based on the ratings and reviews of users who’ve previously taken that course. Web APIs and scraping will be used to achieve this. The application compiles courses from popular sites such as Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, edX and MIT OCW. The user can also set a reminder for the next session of their favourite course. The application also gathers information from the user’s contact list and specifies how many of their contacts have taken the course previously. This will be implemented by custom contact access setting while logging in from Facebook/Gmail. This way, the user need not ask their friends for course recommendations, as CLook does it for them!
